# Systemd user service timeout overrides
# /etc/systemd/user.conf.d/99-cachyos-user.conf
#
# Sets default timeouts for user services (those run by systemd --user).
# These are services started for each logged-in user session.
#
# Kept aligned with system timeouts (timeouts.conf) for consistency.
# User services rarely need different timeout policies than system services.
#
# Examples of user services: ssh-agent, gpg-agent, pipewire, desktop portals
#
# Validated: Drop-in location and syntax correct per Arch Wiki.
# See: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/User

# DefaultTimeoutStartSec: Time to wait for service to start
# DefaultTimeoutStopSec: Time to wait for service to stop before SIGKILL
# DefaultTimeoutAbortSec: Time to wait after SIGABRT before SIGKILL
