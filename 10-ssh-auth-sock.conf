# SSH agent socket for systemd user sessions
# $HOME/.config/environment.d/10-ssh-auth-sock.conf
#
# Sets SSH_AUTH_SOCK for graphical sessions started via systemd (COSMIC, GNOME, etc).
# This file is read by systemd --user when starting the user session.
#
# Requires: systemctl --user enable --now ssh-agent.service
#
# Validated: File location and format correct per Arch Wiki.
# See: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSH_keys#SSH_agents
#
# The socket path uses XDG_RUNTIME_DIR which is typically /run/user/<UID>.
# This ensures the socket is user-private and cleaned up on logout.
#
# NOTE: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is set by systemd-logind for logged-in users.
# In non-systemd environments (containers, chroot, SSH without PAM), this
# variable may not be set and this file will not work. The companion file
# 10-ssh-auth-sock.fish handles this with explicit existence checks.
# For non-systemd environments, use: export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-agent-$USER.socket

SSH_AUTH_SOCK=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/ssh-agent.socket
